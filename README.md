The league structure should be as follows:
We have leagues folder
    This contains a file that simply holds the season number
    Then we have the seasons folder containing all the leagues for that season.  We start at 1 etc.
        Then we have a directory for each tier of the game.  We will start with 3
            This directory will contain the files relating to cup matches
            The folders in here will be one for each league
                Finally this will contain a csv containing the league ordering
                A file containing the teams user ids
                The schedule for the league
